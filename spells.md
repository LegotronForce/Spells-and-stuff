## Spells
Spells are "a magical formula intended to trigger a magical effect on a person or objects," as read from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incantation). Spells range from basic spells that can light a candle, to complex spells that can affect many creatures. These documents are here to tell, and describe, as many spells as possible, in an easy way that even common-folk can even understand it.
